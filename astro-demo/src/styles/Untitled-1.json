            "content": "\n<p>If you’ve been looking online for creative privacy fence ideas for your backyard, then you’re in luck! Your backyard fence doesn’t have to be plain or boring. You deserve a fence that you’re proud of, one that makes the entire neighborhood jealous. You deserve a stylish fence that’s durable, private, and affordable. Your fence will provide greater peace of mind as you won’t have nosy neighbors trying to peek into your backyard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many kinds of privacy fences with unique designs for your gorgeous backyard.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.superiorfenceandrail.com/\">Superior Fence &amp; Rail</a>&nbsp;is committed to helping you find the perfect fence to suit your needs. Our expert team will quickly and efficiently install your dream fence, all at an affordable price. Continue reading to learn about some of the most creative privacy fence ideas for your backyard.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Privacy Fence Ideas You’ll Love</h1>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;Board-on-Board&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.superiorfenceandrail.com/fence-types/wood-fence/\">Wood</a>&nbsp;Fence</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One great choice for a backyard privacy fence is a board-on-board wooden fence. These wooden fences use overlapping boards to provide complete privacy. If they are built properly, board-on-board wood fences can be incredibly durable and last for many years. If your main goal is to get a sleek, natural&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.superiorfenceandrail.com/fence-types/wood-fence/wood-fence-gallery/\">wooden</a>&nbsp;fence that fully blocks out the rest of the world, this fence is a great choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;Piano Key Lattice&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.superiorfenceandrail.com/fence-types/redwood-fence/\">Redwood</a>&nbsp;Fence</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If a board-on-board fence isn’t your style, then perhaps a Piano Key lattice redwood fence is. This is a fence made of vertically-oriented wood slats that are evenly spaced apart, which creates a piano key pattern.&nbsp;You’ll likely be able to choose how far apart you want the wood slats to be. The Piano Key lattice is a gorgeous upgrade when compared to a traditional board-on-board redwood fence. You’ll love this fence so much that you’ll be singing its praises to the Piano Man every night!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;Horizontal Redwood Fence</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Horizontal privacy fences are quite popular these days. They boast a modern fence design that’s usually built with higher-quality redwood, or even exotic woods for a more sophisticated look. With this design, the redwood fence planks lay horizontally instead of vertically. You can choose to have 1 or 2 inches of space in between the planks. You may also opt to have the planks touching each other for maximum privacy. Your friends will all be jealous of your beautiful horizontal redwood fence whenever they stop by to visit!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.superiorfenceandrail.com/fence-types/cedar-fence/\">Cedar</a>&nbsp;Stockade Fence</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Cedar is a gorgeous type of wood that’s lightweight and durable, making it a top pick for backyard privacy fences. A well-built cedar fence can easily stand up to all kinds of weather, as well as insects, rot, and decay.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.superiorfenceandrail.com/fence-types/cedar-fence/cedar-fence-gallery/\">Cedar</a>&nbsp;stockade fences have each vertical fence picket tightly installed side-by-side for lots of privacy. It’s also more affordable than other privacy fences. If you want a durable, visually appealing fence that won’t break the bank, invest in a cedar stockade fence!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.superiorfenceandrail.com/fence-types/vinyl-fence/\">Vinyl</a>&nbsp;Picket Fence</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The vinyl picket fence is a true American classic. You can’t go wrong with a traditional picket fence. However, if you choose a fencing company with high-quality vinyl and lots of color choices, you can really get creative. Vinyl picket fences are durable, aesthetically pleasing, and affordable. They may not offer as much privacy as other fences, but they can still effectively block out those nosy neighbors. If your old-school father-in-law ever comes over to visit, he’ll surely appreciate your vinyl picket fence!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6.</strong>&nbsp;Vinyl Fence with Lattice Top</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Lattice fences combine the best of both worlds. The base provides total privacy, while the lattice top lets some light and air pass through. These vinyl fences are great for families with pools in their backyards. On a cool summer day, having some additional sun and a cool breeze can make those afternoon swims much more fun!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>7.</strong>&nbsp;Scalloped Vinyl Fence</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A scalloped vinyl fence, on the other hand, adds small curves to the mix. They add a unique visual twist to your backyard and give it some extra elegance. They are also quite durable if they’re made from high-quality&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.superiorfenceandrail.com/fence-types/vinyl-fence/vinyl-fence-gallery/\">vinyl</a>. Anyone driving by your house will surely be impressed by your stylish scalloped vinyl fence.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp;Picture Frame Board-on-Board Redwood Fence</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a type of privacy fence where wooden boards are installed with an overlapping pattern, which creates a solid privacy barrier. Then, they’re framed with horizontal rails at the top and bottom. This gives your privacy fence that unique “picture frame” look. What makes this fence special is that it appears the same on both sides, giving a truly aesthetically pleasing appearance. It’s a beloved type of fence nationwide due to its beauty and durability. It’s also great for those pesky neighbors who always try to look into your backyard. These&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.superiorfenceandrail.com/fence-types/redwood-fence/redwood-fence-gallery/\">redwood</a>&nbsp;fences use heavy-duty, pressure-treated wood that is highly resistant to termites and rot. Plus, the overlapping wooden boards greatly increase the strength of the fence, making it a smart choice for any homeowner.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>9.</strong>&nbsp;Stepped Horizontal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.superiorfenceandrail.com/fence-types/trex-fence/\">Trex</a>&nbsp;Fence</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Stepped horizontal Trex fences are a wonderful choice for those with backyards on a slope. They can mimic the form of a sloping backyard. Most Trex posts are made of a dense wood-plastic composite (WPC), making them incredibly sturdy. They also tend to be quite thick, which makes them great for areas with high wind. These fences can easily withstand inclement weather and keep your backyard protected from curious onlookers. Plus, the interlocking pickets that stepped horizontal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.superiorfenceandrail.com/fence-types/trex-fence/trex-fence-gallery/\">Trex</a>&nbsp;fences have will prevent any sort of gaps. This provides complete privacy and greater peace of mind for you and your family. If you’re in a nosy neighborhood with neighbors you can’t stand or trust, you’ll want a stepped horizontal Trex fence.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">10.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.superiorfenceandrail.com/fence-types/chain-link-fence/\">Chain Link</a>&nbsp;Privacy Fence</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Tall chain link fences can provide a decent amount of privacy for your backyard. They may not provide total privacy, but you can customize your fence! You can choose to block the view through the fence posts by adding plastic privacy slats. They come in many different colors and styles, giving you true creative freedom. You can also add some greenery to your fence for the privacy you crave. Consider adding flowers, vines, and shrubs to cover any open spots. If you’re looking for a simple yet sleek, heavy-duty privacy fence that’s easy to maintain, you’ll want a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.superiorfenceandrail.com/fence-types/chain-link-fence/chain-link-fence-gallery/\">chain link</a>&nbsp;fence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ready to Bring Your Privacy Fence Ideas to Life?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s time to make your dream privacy fence a reality.

Superior Fence &amp; Rail is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.superiorfenceandrail.com/about-us/why-superior-fence-rail/\">highly-rated fence company</a>&nbsp;for a reason.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our fence building team is among the best in the industry. They are patient, experienced, and dedicated to the art of fence building. Plus, they know that a fence is a fundamental piece of any Columbus home. They will work with you and do their best to meet all of your fencing needs. Superior wooden fences always have a leg up on the competition because of this. When you need reliable, friendly, and efficient fencing services, you’ll always want to give us a call.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Top Wood Fence Builders in Columbus – Superior Fence &amp; Rail&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A large majority of our Columbus customers prefer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.superiorfenceandrail.com/fence-types/wood-fence/\">wooden fencing</a>&nbsp;over other kinds of fences. Superior Fence &amp; Rail of Columbus uses only the best materials for your fence. We use high-quality, pressure-treated pine to build your wooden fence, right at your location. This way, you will be certain that you picked the right fencing company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You also get a 15-year warranty against termite damage and rot, plus a lifetime warranty for wooden fence posts and horizontal rails. With a variety of customization options available, you’ll be thrilled with your fencing choice, and won’t ever want to trust any other company for your fencing needs!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Our Process</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We fully install your new wood fence right on your property. Each wood post is set in concrete to stay sturdy and upright. We then use hot-dipped galvanized ring shank nails to attach each board. This helps them resist rust and other kinds of damage. Our custom buildings are much stronger than pre-made panels, thanks to this method. Your heavy-duty wood fence is designed to endure harsh conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our board-on-board style provides complete coverage and privacy with overlapping boards. Stockade fencing uses boards that sit next to each other without overlapping for extra privacy. The shadowbox style offers some privacy from the outside world. However, it isn’t fully opaque from the side, meaning it has lower wind resistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wood fencing typically isn’t as tough as vinyl or aluminum fences. With some regular maintenance, your wood fence can look sleek and beautiful for years on end. Regular staining and sealing protect against inclement weather, fading, and other damage. We offer all the classic wood fence styles for your home. Our fence builders can also customize special designs if you have a specific plan for enhancing your home.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ready to Get Started?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding the best wood fence builders doesn’t have to be a struggle.

We’re one of the few fencing companies that can say that, and prove it. This choice lets us offer our own features such as PrivacyLock, SolarShield, StayStrong, and HeartWood. Other reputable fence companies source from distributors with lower product quality, which is a disservice to their customers. Superior Fence &amp; Rail installs top-notch vinyl fences every time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have over 20 years of experience in fabricating and installing millions of feet of vinyl fencing. This taught us a great deal about the process of installing vinyl fencing. This also led us to become the first fence company to establish our own vinyl specifications. Because of this, all of our customers receive a durable and sleek vinyl fence that meets our strict quality standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can pick from many different styles, colors, and profiles for your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.superiorfenceandrail.com/fence-types/vinyl-fence/vinyl-fence-gallery/\">vinyl fence</a>. Superior Fence &amp; Rail of Cleveland lets YOU decide how your fence looks. With us on your side, you’re guaranteed to get a strong vinyl fence with an elegant appearance, one that can withstand almost anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">PrivacyLock</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a unique locking mechanism that we use for all our vinyl fences. It significantly reduces wind penetration and lowers the chances of damage occurring. Superior vinyl fences provide the privacy and security your home deserves.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">SolarShield</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>SolarShield is a proprietary acrylic blend that protects your gorgeous vinyl fence from the sun’s harmful ultraviolet rays. It protects the sheen and color of your vinyl fence for many years. Superior vinyl fences have an extra layer of protection that other companies just can’t match.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">StayStrong</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With StayStrong, your vinyl fence is much stronger and more resistant to wind. StayStrong rails for your vinyl fence have 33% deeper grooves, allowing more of the fence picket to be firmly embedded in the rail. StayStrong makes our vinyl fences among the strongest fences on the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">HeartWood</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Heartwood is a special type of vinyl fence that encapsulates the beauty of natural wood. Choose from two amazing colors, Golden Oak or Red Chestnut, for your vinyl fence. With HeartWood, you get extra strength and the sleek, natural look of a wooden finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ready to Work with the Top Vinyl Fence Installers?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Superior Fence &amp; Rail of Cleveland are the top vinyl fence installers in the Cleveland area.

While chain link fences are more commonly seen around commercial properties, they can also be found in residential areas. For instance, you might spot a 4-foot chain link fence enclosing a backyard, or a taller 12-foot version around a government building for security purposes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also find commercial fencing at tennis and basketball courts, farms, playgrounds, and various industrial sites.

Plus, it will provide security, privacy, and property demarcation for your backyard. And it can serve as a decorative element to your property that will increase your home’s value. If you’re a homeowner in the Kansas City area, you’ll definitely want to invest in a wood picket fence.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://superiorfence.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/14105751/kansas-city-fence-pickets-640x360-1.webp\" alt=\"picket fence builder\n\" class=\"wp-image-3834\" srcset=\"https://superiorfence.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/14105751/kansas-city-fence-pickets-640x360-1.webp 640w, https://superiorfence.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/14105751/kansas-city-fence-pickets-640x360-1-300x169.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After all, wood picket fences are one of the most sought-after kinds of fences on the market today. Superior Fence &amp; Rail of Kansas City is your local&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.superiorfenceandrail.com/fence-types/wood-fence/wood-fence-gallery/\">wood fence</a>&nbsp;company of choice. Wood pickets are affordable for many homeowners and can add a gorgeous natural look that complements your home’s landscaping and garden.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Will My Wooden Fence Need To Be Stained Or Sealed?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.superiorfenceandrail.com/fence-types/wood-fence/wood-fence-gallery/\">wooden picket fences</a>&nbsp;are naturally sleek and beautiful, they will most need to be stained and/or sealed at some point. This is because humidity changes can cause wood to naturally expand and contract. This is a normal occurrence, so do not worry if you notice this happening to your fence pickets. Keep in mind that not properly treating your wood picket fence can cause it to crack, warp, or fade over time. Staining and/or sealing each fence picket will also help prevent any mold, rot, and decay from developing over time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Often Will I Need To Stain Or Seal My Wooden Fence?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>How often you’ll need to stain or seal your new wood picket fence depends on the type of wood used, the time of year, and the current climate in your area. With a pressure-treated pine fence, you’ll need to wait until the wood is completely dry before attempting to stain or seal it. If the wood is still wet when you stain or seal the fence pickets, the treatment will not adhere properly to the wood. However, waiting too long may result in your picket fence weathering too quickly. As a result, you may have to sand or wash it with a special cleaner to stain or seal it properly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep these general guidelines in mind when deciding how long to wait before staining or sealing your new wood picket fence. You should consider the type of wood used for your picket fence and then wait between 1 and 6 months before staining or sealing your fence. This will allow your wood pickets to be sufficiently dried, weathered, and cured. You likely won’t have to wait as long if you live in an area that is typically drier and does not receive a lot of rain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Superior Fence &amp; Rail of Kansas City will provide you with some best practices for staining or sealing your wood picket fence for the first time. We’ll also share our recommendations on how often you should restain or reseal your fence pickets.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Other Fence Picket Styles Do We Have?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Superior Fence &amp; Rail is the top fencing company in Kansas City for a reason. Not only do we offer fully customizable wood picket fences, but we also provide other kinds of fence picket styles for your home or business. Other popular alternatives to a wood picket fence are the vinyl picket fence and aluminum picket fence.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.superiorfenceandrail.com/fence-types/vinyl-fence/vinyl-fence-gallery/?tx_portfolio_category=picket\">Vinyl Picket Fence</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A Superior vinyl picket fence showcases the charm of the classic “white picket fence”. All our vinyl products were designed by Superior Fence and Rail strictly for Superior Fence and Rail. With truly innovative features such as PrivacyLock, SolarShield, StayStrong, and HeartWood, you get more than just a fence; you get the best fence. Our fence profiles are among the sturdiest in the industry and are backed by a lifetime transferable warranty. You will get a top-quality vinyl fence, and most importantly, you will get peace of mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What Is PrivacyLock?&nbsp;</strong>PrivacyLock is a unique locking mechanism that eliminates the risk of failure compared to other vinyl fences. Unlike traditional tongue and groove fencing, our PrivacyLock locks together giving you superior security with your vinyl fence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>What is SolarShield?</strong> Naturally, the sun can discolor standard vinyl fencing since fences are outdoors and exposed to the elements. This is why all Superior Fences come standard with SolarShield. This consists of a proprietary acrylic blend that protects your fence from the harmful UV rays of the sun. SolarShield gives your vinyl fence a protective outer layer engineered to reduce oxidation significantly and the damaging effects of the sun’s rays. Even in harsh climates, SolarShield protects the color and sheen of your fence for longer periods of time in comparison to other vinyl fencing products. Simply put, <em>there is no better protection under the sun than SolarShield</em>. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>What Is StayStrong? </strong>We invented StayStrong so your vinyl fence can withstand greater wind loads, making your fence stronger. This strength is possible because we engineered our rails with 33% deeper grooves so that more of the picket embeds in the rail.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>What Is HeartWood? </strong>Our HeartWood vinyl fence line gives you the rustic, warm beauty of wood without the maintenance! HeartWood comes in two amazing color selections: Golden Oak and Red Chestnut.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.superiorfenceandrail.com/fence-types/aluminum-fence/\">Aluminum Picket Fence</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Superior Fence &amp; Rail of Kansas City has four unique aluminum fencing product lines from which you can choose. We also offer additional fence picket spacing and rail height options for even greater customization to your liking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Superior offers the best selection of product styles and grades on the market. All of our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.superiorfenceandrail.com/fence-types/aluminum-fence/aluminum-fence-gallery/\">aluminum fencing</a>&nbsp;products include SolarShield technology to prevent fence picket fading and chalking. Our powder coating goes well above and beyond the industry standard and our fencing can easily withstand up to 3,000 hours of continuous salt spray testing, which is double the amount that most fences can handle!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aluminum is an incredibly strong and durable metal that can last for quite a long time. These fences are an excellent choice for anyone living in an area with inclement weather and not wanting to spend too much time or money on costly fence picket repairs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you’re shopping for an aluminum picket fence, vinyl or a wooden picket fence, you can rest assured knowing that our Superior fencing is guaranteed to stand strong.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Call Us Today for Your New Wood Picket Fence</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Superior Fence &amp; Rail is excited to work with you and install a heavy-duty wood picket fence for your Kansas City home.

In addition, if you reside in a neighborhood or community with a homeowner’s association (HOA), they will likely need one as part of your HOA review process.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://superiorfence.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/14110518/property-survey-for-fence-640x360-1.webp\" alt=\"getting a property survey for fence\" class=\"wp-image-3837\" srcset=\"https://superiorfence.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/14110518/property-survey-for-fence-640x360-1.webp 640w, https://superiorfence.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/14110518/property-survey-for-fence-640x360-1-300x169.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Is Land Survey For Fence The Same As A Property Survey For Fence?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Land surveys are an essential part of starting a new project, selling property, or purchasing a new property. Sometimes a land survey is referred to as a property survey. The two have very similar, but not identical definitions. &nbsp;A&nbsp;<strong>property survey</strong>&nbsp;confirms the boundaries of a given property&nbsp;according to records and legal descriptions. This is the type of survey most often used when installing a new fence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A&nbsp;<strong>land survey</strong>&nbsp;shows the shape and boundaries of a piece of land. Property surveys are usually a requirement when hiring a professional for improvements to your home and/or property. A land survey is crucial when considering purchasing land or a home. This is to ensure you know exactly&nbsp;<em>what&nbsp;</em>you are purchasing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the trade, you may also hear the term “plot plan.” A plot plan usually involves the construction of a new home, where the home is figured into a property survey. This shows where the home is on the plot of land and also shows all setbacks and right-of-ways. A plot plan is required to obtain a certificate of occupancy (CO) in most counties to pass final inspections and allow you to close on your home and move in.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How To Determine Property Lines For Fence</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First and foremost, before measuring for your fence, you must determine your property line boundaries. You will need to have a copy of your property survey to ensure your fence placement is within the correct boundaries. Keep in mind, it is also important that you are aware of any required setbacks or right-of-way’s (if applicable for your property), prior to measuring. If you do not have a property survey, it is crucial that you do. This is not only for your new fence installation but also because many professional contractors will require one before doing any kind of remodeling or improvement project on your property. A survey is the only way you can accurately determine your property boundaries. As a proactive home or business owner, this is an important document to keep on hand for reference.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How Do I Mark Property Lines?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Surveyors will generally mark the 4-corners of your property with a ribbon or stake during your initial survey of the property. In many cases, these markers may still be visible years down the road. This will give you some idea of where your property lines are; however, to be certain, we recommend looking at your property survey for the exact location of your property lines. If you cannot use your survey as a reference to mark the lines yourself, contact a professional surveyor for guidance. Remember that most reputable fence companies, such as Superior Fence &amp; Rail, can determine your property lines based on your property survey or plot plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How To Measure For A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.superiorfenceandrail.com/palm-beach/fence-types/\">New Fence</a></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many fencing specialists suggest you use a fencing formula to measure for a fence. However, the formula is as simple as measuring the length of your fence line accurately and then dividing by the width of the panels. Here at Superior Fence &amp; Rail of Palm Beach, we take all the guesswork out of how to measure for a fence and other fence parameter questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://superiorfence.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/14110606/how-to-measure-for-fence-640x360-1.webp\" alt=\"how to measure for fence\" class=\"wp-image-3839\" srcset=\"https://superiorfence.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/14110606/how-to-measure-for-fence-640x360-1.webp 640w, https://superiorfence.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/14110606/how-to-measure-for-fence-640x360-1-300x169.webp 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As your local professional fence installer, we do all this for you!
