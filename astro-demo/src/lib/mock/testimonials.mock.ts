      "Hi Kenny. I just wanted to write and let you know I absolutely love my fence. I was hesitant to go with your company because you were the highest price, but I’m so glad I did. It looks incredible and Tyler did an awesome job. He built it *exactly* as you planned it to be built. Thank you!",

      "I look for three things when buying a service or a product. Quality product, reasonable price, great service. I got way more when I hired Superior Fence. They arrived on time, removed my old fence, and installed 90% of the new fence in one day. Finishing up in a couple of hours, hand built the gate, the next morning. We did a walk around checking that I was pleased. They didn’t disappear like some repair folks do and then drop you a bill in the mail. About 10 days later the owner called me to see if I was happy or if anything needed to be fixed. I thought companies stopped caring after they got the check. You will be very satisfied with Super Fence & Rail of Pensacola.",

      "…after a lot of research, went with Superior out of Raleigh, NC. Great install, super people all the way. A few weeks later I had a small issue… I wanted to make you personally aware of the help I got from Stacey Milan out of the Raleigh/Apex Superior office. She was so personable and professional – and immediately responded and took care of my small issue. But it was more than that. She made me feel like I mattered. So many companies, especially when they are part of a huge operation like yours, don’t get it that each transaction is important to the people who put their trust, and dollars, into a product. Well sir, I’m glad I did. The product is great, very happy with the install, but especially impressed with the customer service.",

      "We cannot ask for better service. This company went above and beyond everything that they told us they would do. Jason and his crew were here ahead of time and did not leave until the job was finished. He made sure that we understood everything they have done the service warranty and everything that goes with taking care of the fence. So if you need any type of fencing don’t hesitate to have superior fence do your job. From beginning process to final installation. These guys are top.",
